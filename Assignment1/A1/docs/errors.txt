Bug Report
==========

Error 1:
  Class: All Classes
  Method: All Methods
  Test Method: NA
  Message: Got an error while setting up the project in IntelliJ so had to set it to version 14.

Error 2:
  Class: Link
  Method: compareTo()
  Test Method: compareTo_zero1(), compareTo_zero2(), compareTo_negative1(), compareTo_negative2(), compareTo_negative3(), compareTo_positive()
  Message: Link class was not abstract and did not override the compareTo(Link l) abstract method of the Comparable<> Interface.

Error 3:
  Class: Link
  Method: Link() constructor
  Message: Commented the used being set to true as by default we cannot consider the new link to be part of the set of the shortest paths

Error 4:
  Class: Link
  Method: getAdj()
  Test Method: getAdj_city1(), getAdj_city2(), getAdj_city3()
  Message: Updated the false result in ternary operation for getAdj() method and also added a if condition, now it returns the adjacent city based on the passed city.
           Considering there is a link between the two cities.
           The if condition handles the unspecified behavior of the method, when a city is passed other than city1 & city2.

Error 5:
  Class: City
  Method: toString()
  Test Method: toString_Test()
  Message: Removed the distance being concatenated at the end of the city name string being returned.

Error 6:
  Class: City
  Method: compare()
  Test Method: compare_zero(), compare_positive(), compare_negative()
  Message: Swapped the c2.distance - c1.distance in the return statement as it wouldn't give correct output.

Error 7:
  Class: CityComparator
  Method: compare()
  Test Method: compare_xSmaller(), compare_xEqual(), compare_xLarger()
  Message: Swapped the y & x in the return statement as it wouldn't give correct output.

Error 8:
  Class: City
  Method: getLinksTo()
  Test Method: getLinksTo_Test1(), getLinksTo_Test2(), getLinksTo_Test3()
  Message: Changed the nested if return statement to true & the main return statement to false as it was giving wrong output.
           The nested if return statement shows that the path has been found whereas the main return statement returns false as the path is not found.

============
Message: Added linkName() method in the Link class to return the String representation of the Link & wrote the test cases for the same in LinkTest class.
